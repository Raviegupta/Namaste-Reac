### What is NPM ?
- It is the default package manager for Node.js. (a popular runtime environment for running JavaScript on the server-side.)
- npm is used to install, share, and manage dependencies (both local and global) for Node.js projects.
- It allows developers to specify project dependencies in a package.json file and easily install or update them using simple commands.
- Scripts: npm allows developers to define custom scripts in their package.json file, which can be executed using the npm run command.

### What is npx ?
- `npx` is `a command-line tool` that comes with npm
- It is used to execute Node.js packages directly, either from a local node_modules folder or from the npm registry. <br>

use cases of npx: 
- npx provides a convenient way `to execute Node.js packages and commands` without the need for manual installation or management, making it a useful tool for development workflows.
- **Executing Packages:** :- `npx` allows us to run a package without having to install it globally or locally.
- **Package Discovery** : npx can also be used to discover and run packages from the npm registry without having to know the exact package name or version. For example, we can run `npx create-react-app my-app` to create a new React app without having to install create-react-app globally.

### What is difference between `dependencies` vs `devDependencies`?
**dependencies** : Packages required by our application in `production`.
**devDependencies** : Packages that are only needed for `local development and testing`.

###  What is `.gitignore`? What should we add and not add into it?
- gitignore is a file used by the version control system Git to specify intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
- These untracked files are often files generated as part of the local development process or files that contain sensitive information, temporary files, or build artifacts that should not be committed to the repository.
- whatever we can regenerate, we don't push to git.
- and whatever we don't push them to git, we have to add them in gitignore.
- Common Use Cases:
    1. Ignoring auto-generated files (e.g., log files, cache files, build artifacts).
    2. Ignoring sensitive information (e.g., API keys, credentials) that should not be committed to the repository.
```
# Ignore all files with .log extension
*.log

# Ignore node_modules directory
node_modules/

# Ignore .env files containing environment-specific settings
.env
```

### - What is the difference between `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
`package.json`
- configuration file for npm
- defines metaDeta of our project
- it tells us what version of package is installed
- we can do manuall edit here

`package-lock.json`
- automatically generated by npm/yarn when dependencies are installed or updated.
- manuall edit or modification is not recoomended.
- it tell what `exact version` of library we are using. (package-lock.json me caret ya tilde use ni hota )
- it locks the specific version.
- it maintain the what exact version we are using on our systenm, will be exactly same on the server or production. => that is what integrity is there in package-lock-json (sha512)

#### Why should I not modify `package-lock.json`?
Modifying the package-lock.json file directly is generally not recommended for several reasons:
-  It is designed to be a representation of the exact dependency tree that was generated when you installed your project's dependencies. Manually editing this file can lead to inconsistencies between your dependencies and what is specified in the package-lock.json.
- package-lock.json file ensures that the entire dependency tree for your project is consistent and reproducible.
- `Automatic Updates`: When you run commands like npm install, npm uses the package-lock.json file to determine which versions of dependencies to install.

### What is `node_modules` ? Is it a good idea to push that on git?
- it just like a database of our npm. (node_module is huge.)
- contains all the data that we fetch from npm

- Never put our node_modules in github repository (So, we should add node_modules to .gitignore )=> bcoz our package-lock.json has sufficient information to regenerate or recreate our node_modules exactly the same.
- we can regenerate node_modules if we have package.json & package-lock.json by using the commands `npm install`

### what does caret(^) & tilde(~) do in package.json ?
- <img src="https://i.ibb.co/m9Cgsyk/caret-tilde.png" alt="caret-tilde" width="500px">
- <img src="https://i.ibb.co/bL7w8ws/caret-tilde-2.png" alt="caret-tilde-2" width="500px">

- caret (^) :- updates all patches, minor versions.
- tilde (~) :- updates all patches(bug fix only).
