#### Q. is React a Global Object ?
Yes, React is a global object

---

#### Q. What is React.createElement ?
- Plane JavaScript Object.
- createElement let us create a React Element. It serves `as an alternative to writing JSX`.
```
React.createElement(
  type,
  [props],
  [...children]
)
```
1st Parameter :- tag name string (such as 'div' or 'span')
2nd Parameter :- `props` :- either `null` or an `object`. If we pass `null`, it will be treated the same as an empty object.
3rd Parameter :- its an optional, zero or more child nodes. They can be any react nodes, including React elements, strings, numbers, emptynodes (null, undefined, true, false) and arrays of React nodes.

---

#### Q. What is createRoot ? Why do we need to createRoot ? can we have more than 1 root ?
- `createRoot` lets us create a root to display React components inside a browser DOM node.
- `createRoot` tells whatever we passes inside this becomes the root of the app. **Any existing DOM elements inside are replaced when render is called.**
```
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
```
`root` :- It is the place where React runs.
we need createRoot bcoz **React wants to know where we want to push our stuff**.
generally in our app we see just 1 root, that is the single place where we are injecting our react tool (most of the app have 1 root & 1 render method) and everything we will build, we will build inside it.

---

#### Q. What is root.render()?
- `render()` :- it is a function, it modifies our DOM.
- React will override whatever is in my existing root & react will replace it with whatever we give inside render.

---

#### Q. What will happen if we keep script above react cdn links ? will it be rendered ?
No, it wil not be rendered. that's why we keep script tag below the cdn of react.

---

#### Q. What is JSX ? How JSX came ?
- Initially, the react was built on `React.createElement` & t**his was core of react**.
- Initially the whole idea of creating a React is to write whole HTML inside JavaScript & that's not user friendly. that's why JSX came. So, JSX is not the only way of creating element.
- JSX stands for JavaScript XML.
-JSX allows us to write HTML in React. JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.

---

#### Q. What is stylesheet ?
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="">
```
- `rel` attribute :- define the **relationship** betweeen **linked file and the html document**.
- `rel="stylesheet"` :- specifies a preferred style. (always applied when stylesheets are enabled)
- `rel="alternate stylesheet"` :- Specifying alternative style sheets in a web page provides a way for users to see multiple versions of a page, based on their needs or preferences.

---

#### Q. Why we import CSS file in head ?
- The loading of the page is asynchronous, so if you have external stylesheet `it will load the css file immediately` when it reach the link tag, that is why it is good to have at the top in head.
- CSS in the head is to `eliminate the latency` in the network request, ie there is no network request for the CSS.

---

Q. What is window ?
- It's a `Global Object`. given by `Browser`. represnts `Browser's window`. gives access to lot of `superpowers`. ex:- 
    - window.localStorage
    - window.location
- All global JavaScript `objects`, `functions`, and `variables` automatically become members of the window object.

Note:- <br>
    * `Global variables` are _`properties` of the window object_.
    * `Global functions` are `_methods` of the window object_.
    * Even the `document object (of the HTML DOM)` is a _property of the window object_.

 `window.document.getElementById("header");`
  is the same as
  `document.getElementById("header");`

Q. What is BOM ?
- JavaScript Window - The Browser Object Model
- here, we have all the details related to the browser.
    * location
    * navigator
    * history
    * screen
    * frames
    * XML http request

---

#### Q. What is Bundler ?
- `development tool` that **combines many JavaScript code files into a single one** and that is ready for `production-ready loadable in the browser`.
- `puts together` all our `JavaScript code and its dependencies` and throws a new JavaScript output file with everything merged, ready for the web, commonly known as the bundle file.
- some bundlers are :-
    - Web-Pack (npx create-react-app by default uses Web-Pack bundler)
    - parcel
    - vite
    - browserify
    - ES build
    - Roll up

### Process of Installing Any Package Manager say npm in our app.
`npm init -y` :- will skip up lot of option. <br>
`npm init` :- this will ask us a lot of question & will give us a **package.json** file.
---
### How to install any package (let say parcel) in our app ?
- Before installing any package, it is necessary to have a package manager.
- `npm install` [package name] 
- `npm i` [package name]

- `npm install` `-D` [package name] 
    - `-D` flag :- Dev dependency [-D means we are `installing parcel with Dev dependency`]

- `npm install` `--save-dev` [package name] :- (it does same thing as npm install -D )
---
### How to install React & ReactDOM in our app ?
- since, using `cdn & React.createElememt is not the efficient way to use react`. This is bcoz when react version is updated then we have to change the cdn manually.
- So, we will install the react by :- 
```
npm install react
```

```
npm install react-dom
```
#### here -D flag are not required bcoz i want react & reactDOM in Global not in just development environment.
---
### How we will ignite (run) our App ?
run command 
```
npx parcel [entry point]
```
ex:- `npx parcel index.html`
This will provide local host like :-  Server running at http://localhost:1234  <br>
earlier we used to inject cdn for React & ReactDOM. but here we already have these packages in our node_modules which we just installed by commands `npm install react`  & `npm install react-dom`. hence, we need to import these  to use react & react-dom. <br>
**Note:- npx parcel index.html => it just creates a development build for us & it hosts on our server.**

---
### How to Import React & ReactDOM to our App ?
write these commands in js file. (now we don't need cdn links)
```
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client"
```

Note:- Normal JavaScript Browser doesn't understand `import` or `export`. So, we need to tell browser this is not a normal JS file, this is a `module`. we have to specify this by adding attribute `type = 'module'` in script tag. ex:-

```
<script type="module" src="App.js"></script>
```

Now if we do any changes in css or js it will be automatically reflected. This is known as `LIVE SERVER powered by PARCEL`. This Functionality is known as **HMR (HOT Module Replacement)**

### Q. What are `.parcel-cache` and `dist` folders ?
- `.parcel-cache` :- parcel needs `some space` to do it's activity & extra stuffs in the form of .parcel-cache
- `dit` folder :- keeps the file minified for us.
---
### How do i tell parcel make a production build ?
using `build` command like this :- `npx parcel build index.html`
- it creates a lot of things.
- it minifies our file.
- parcel build all these files in `dist` folder. dist folder contain
    - .css
    - .css.map
    - .js
    - .js.map
    - .html
- .map is like a helper file.
---
#### What will happen if we delete `dis` folder ?
* `npx parcel build index.html` will breakdown.
* When we run this command => `npx parcel build index.html` => it gives an **error**
- ` "main": "App.js" ` => remove this from `package.json`
* Now `npx parcel build index.html` will run successfully. (aur agar `dis` folder delete bi kar diya h to ye automatically bna lega.)
---
### How to add HTTPS on our server ?
- write npx parcel entry point command with `--https` flag
    `npx parcel index.html --https`
---
### Should we keep `.parcel-cache` and `dist` folders in .gitignore ?
* **yes** we should **put it in .gitignore**
* Golden Statement :-  anything which is auto generated on server, we should keep it in .gitignore
---
### Q. How React is fast ? Is it only due to VirtualDOM ?
* No. 
* React is fast Itself.
* It need so many things to make it fast.
* React can't make app performant alone, it needs parcel & parcel uses dependencies.
  * If React is Modi Ji then Parcel is Amit Shah 
  * and different packages in node_modules are like different ministers. some are very important and some are less important.
  * In this way sab ek dusre pe dependent hote h.
    * this is known as **Transitive Dependency**
---
### Q. What do you mean by Transitive dependency ?
When we are building a production ready big app which uses minification, bundling, code cleaning, compression, image optimisation, consistent hashing algorithm, Hot Module Replacement and which uses lot of things then we can't do these alone we need lots of dependencies on it. and these dependencies also depends on something, So these kind pf dependencies are known as `Transisitve Dependencies`.

### Q. What is Babel ?
- It's a `JavaScript Compiler` that allows developers to write code using the latest ECMAScript standards (such as ES6, ES7, ES8) and then transform that code into a backward-compatible version of JavaScript that can be run by older browsers or environments. This is called `Transpilation`
* used for `Transpilation`.
* It creates `Pollyfill`
* In our cases, It's a dependency for Parcel.

some key features and use cases of Babel:
- Transpilation:
- Language Features: supports a wide range of JavaScript language features, including arrow functions, classes, template literals, destructuring, async/await, and more.
- Polyfilling: used to polyfill missing features in older browsers by including additional code that provides missing functionality not natively supported by the browser.

### Concept behind JSX.
earlier we used to write like this
```
import { createElement } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

const heading = createElement("h1", {key: "h1", }, "Ravie Enterprises");

const ul = createElement("ul", {key: "ul", }, [
  createElement("li", {key: "first",}, "About us"), 
  createElement("li", {key: "second",}, "Products"), 
  createElement("li", {key: "third",}, "Offers") 
]);

const container = createElement("div", {}, [heading, ul])

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(container);
```

**After introducing of JSX** we are writing like this
```
// using single line
const heading = <h1 id="title" key="h1">Ravie Enterprises by JSX</h1>

// if using multiple line then we have to put ()
const heading = (
  <h1 id="title" key="h1">
    Ravie Enterprises by JSX
  </h1>
  );
```

### Q. Is JSX is html inside JavaScript ?
- No, JSX is not html inside JavaScript.
- This is a HTML like Syntax (syntax extension to JavaScript). but it is not HTML inside JavaScript. This is a fancy way of writing HTML inside JavaScript.
- 

### Advantages of JSX.
- readability
- developer experience
- syntatical sugar
- less code
- good to maintain
- no repetition
- code for humans

Note:- `syntactic sugar` is syntax within a programming language that is designed to make things `easier to read or to express`. It makes the language "sweeter" for human use: things can be expressed more clearly, more concisely
