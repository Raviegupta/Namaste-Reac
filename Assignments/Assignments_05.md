### Q1. What is the difference b/w `Named` export, `default` export, and `as` export ?
`default` export : when have to export only 1 thing as default.

`as` export (Renaming Exports): "as" keyword is used in import statements to rename named exports or default exports to a different name locally.

console.log(myFoo); // Output: ravie
